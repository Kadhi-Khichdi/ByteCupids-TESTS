## For agent 1 :- Accepts input from user and structures it for down stream processing...

PROMPT : 

``` bash
You are an expert AI agent responsible for processing and structuring module information for an online learning platform. Your task is to take a module name and its metadata, then organize it into a well-defined JSON format that can be easily consumed by subsequent AI agents.

**Input:**

*   **Module Name:** [Insert Module Name Here - Example: "Advanced Machine Learning"]
*   **Module Metadata:** [Insert Module Metadata Here - Provide Key-Value Pairs, Examples: "Target Audience: Senior Engineers", "Difficulty Level: Advanced", "Estimated Completion Time: 40 hours", "Keywords: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Python", "Prerequisites: Basic Python, Linear Algebra, Calculus", "Description: This module covers advanced machine learning techniques."]

**Instructions:**

1.  **Data Extraction:**  Carefully extract the module name and all relevant metadata from the input provided.
2.  **JSON Formatting:**  Organize the extracted data into a JSON object with the following structure:

    ```json
    {
      "module_name": "[Extracted Module Name]",
      "metadata": {
        "target_audience": "[Extracted Target Audience - Condense if needed to few words.]",
        "difficulty_level": "[Extracted Difficulty Level]",
        "estimated_completion_time": "[Extracted Estimated Completion Time - estimate if not found using difficulty level]",
        "keywords": "[Extracted Keywords, comma-separated, Maximum 8 keywords]",
        "prerequisites": "[Extracted Prerequisites, comma-separated]",
        "other_metadata": "[Any other extracted metadata, separated by commas with their values. e.g., 'Number of Lessons: 10, Version: 2.0']"
      },
      "agent_notes": "[Add any notes or observations about the input data. For example: 'Metadata was sparse, consider requesting more information in the future.'  or 'Well-defined metadata, easy to process.' ]",
      "interpretation": "[A short interpretation of the module (less than 100 words)]"
    }
    ```

3.  **Keyword Handling:** Extract keywords as accurately as possible. If the keyword input contains vague terms like "etc. etc.", interpret the intent and generate more specific and relevant keywords. The maximum limit for the keywords is 8.
4.  **Metadata Consolidation:** If the input metadata contains diverse information, consolidate it under the `other_metadata` field, ensuring clear separation of key-value pairs for each element by commas. Also use this field to capture any relevant module description in one line.
5.  **Target Audience Refinement:** If the target audience description is lengthy or informal, condense it into a concise phrase (e.g., "Beginner DB Engineers"). The goal is to keep it short while retaining the core meaning.
6.  **Estimated Completion Time:** If "estimated\_completion\_time" is not provided in the input, analyze the "difficulty\_level" and "keywords" to provide a reasonable estimate. Add the estimated completion time to both the "estimated\_completion\_time" field in the JSON and mention how you have derived it from difficulty level and keywords inside `agent_notes`.
7.  **Completeness Check:**  If any crucial metadata is missing (e.g., target audience or difficulty level), include a note in the `"agent_notes"` section indicating what information is missing.
8.  **Data Type Conversion:** Ensure data types are appropriate for the JSON format (e.g., numbers should be represented as numbers, booleans as booleans, and strings as strings).
9.  **Clarity & Conciseness:**  Make sure the JSON is well-formatted, easy to read, and contains only essential information.  Avoid unnecessary repetition.
10. **Interpretation:** Based on the Module name and metadata, write an interpretation on what this module can be interpreted as for the learning platform. This should be less than 100 words.
11. **Keywords Adjustment:** After the interpretation, scan the metadata and interpretation, and generate a new set of keywords that summarises and encapsulates the module in best way possible. Replace the old keywords with this new set.  Make sure to follow the same format as specified above. This is essential for better future results with better keywords. Limit the number of keywords to a maximum of 8.

**Example Input:**

*   **Module Name:** Introduction to Quantum Computing
*   **Module Metadata:** Target Audience: Undergraduate Physics Students who want to learn basics of Quantum Computing, Difficulty Level: Beginner, Keywords: Quantum, Computing, Qubits, Superposition, Module Description : Teaches Basics of Quantum Computing

# SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics

## Introduction

Hey there, future database wizard! Welcome to the wonderful world of SQL. Imagine you're at a massive library with billions of books, and you need to find a specific paragraph in a specific book. How would you do it? You'd need a special language to tell the librarian exactly what you're looking for. That's what SQL is – your way to talk to databases!

Structured Query Language (SQL) is like the universal translator between you and your data. It's how we ask databases questions, tell them to remember new information, update what they know, or forget things we don't need anymore. Whether you're dreaming of becoming a data analyst who uncovers hidden patterns in business data, a web developer building the next big app, or just someone who wants to understand the digital world better – SQL is your golden ticket.

In this journey together, we'll start by learning how to have simple conversations with databases and gradually work our way up to sophisticated data wizardry. I promise by the end, you'll look at every app and website differently, knowing the SQL magic happening behind the scenes!

## Beginner's Guide

### What is SQL and Why Should You Care?

Imagine you've just landed your first job at a coffee shop. On day one, you need to learn the "coffee shop language" – how to ask for specific beans, how to record a sale, how to update inventory when you're running low on milk. SQL is exactly that, but for databases!

SQL (pronounced either as "S-Q-L" or "sequel") was born at IBM in the 1970s, and it's been the go-to database language ever since. I like to think of SQL as having a conversation with a super-organized librarian who knows exactly where everything is:

"Hey, could you show me all the fantasy books published after 2010?"
"Could you add this new book to the science fiction section?"
"That history book has the wrong author listed – can you fix it?"
"We don't need these outdated travel guides anymore – please remove them."

Each of these requests is something you can do with SQL!

### SQL Basics: Your First Database Conversation

When we talk to databases using SQL, we write statements that end with semicolons (;). It's like putting a period at the end of a sentence – it tells the database "I'm done with this thought."

Here's what a simple SQL statement looks like:

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM customers;
```

Don't worry about the exact syntax yet – just notice how it almost reads like a simplified English sentence. By convention, we write SQL keywords (like SELECT and FROM) in ALL CAPS to make them stand out, but the database doesn't actually care about capitalization. I'm going to use the capitalized style because it makes the code easier to read, but feel free to write lowercase if that's more comfortable for you!

### The Four Magic Spells: CRUD Operations

Think of database operations like the four essential spells every wizard needs to know. These are called CRUD operations – Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Master these, and you've got the fundamentals of database magic!

#### Spell #1: SELECT (Read) - Finding Information

This is how we ask the database to show us information:

```sql
SELECT name, price FROM products;
```

This is like saying, "Show me the name and price of all products." If you want to see everything, you can use the asterisk wildcard:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

That's like saying, "Show me everything about all customers!"

Let's say you run a small online bookstore. You might use this to see all your inventory:

```sql
SELECT title, author, price FROM books;
```

And boom! You'll see a list of all your books with their titles, authors, and prices.

#### Spell #2: INSERT (Create) - Adding New Information

When you get a new shipment of books, you need to tell your database:

```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, price)
VALUES ('The SQL Adventure', 'Data Wizard', 19.99);
```

Just like that, you've added a new book to your inventory!

#### Spell #3: UPDATE (Update) - Changing Existing Information

Oops! You made a typo in the author's name, or maybe the price changed. No problem:

```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = 24.99, author = 'Jane Data Wizard'
WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure';
```

This changes the price and fixes the author name for that specific book.

#### Spell #4: DELETE (Delete) - Removing Information

Sold out of a book and not ordering more? You can remove it:

```sql
DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure';
```

Be careful with this one – there's no "undo" button in databases!

### Data Types: Choosing the Right Container

Think of data types like different types of containers. You wouldn't store soup in a shopping bag or groceries in a coffee mug, right? Databases need to know what kind of data they're storing too!

1. **Numbers:**
   - `INTEGER` or `INT`: Whole numbers like 1, 42, or -99 (like counting beans)
   - `DECIMAL(10,2)`: Numbers with decimal points like 19.99 (great for money!)
   - `FLOAT`: Scientific numbers that might need approximate values (like 3.14159265)

2. **Text:**
   - `VARCHAR(50)`: Text of varying length up to 50 characters (like names)
   - `TEXT`: Longer chunks of text (like product descriptions or blog posts)
   - `CHAR(2)`: Fixed-length text (like state abbreviations: NY, CA)

3. **Dates and Times:**
   - `DATE`: Just the date (2023-05-15)
   - `TIME`: Just the time (14:30:00)
   - `TIMESTAMP`: Both date and time (2023-05-15 14:30:00)

4. **Yes/No Values:**
   - `BOOLEAN`: TRUE or FALSE (is this product in stock?)

Choosing the right data type is like choosing the right container – it helps keep your data organized and your database efficient!

[Image: A visual diagram showing different data types represented as different shapes of containers, with examples of data stored in each]

## Intermediate Concepts

### Leveling Up: SQL Clauses That Make You Look Like a Pro

Now that you've got the basics down, let's add some superpowers to your SQL toolkit! These clauses are like special modifiers that make your database queries much more useful in real-world situations.

#### The WHERE Detective: Finding Exactly What You Need

The WHERE clause is like being a detective – it helps you filter through mountains of data to find exactly what you're looking for. If your database is an enormous library, the WHERE clause lets you say, "I only want books about dragons, not everything in the fantasy section!"

```sql
SELECT title, author, price FROM books
WHERE genre = 'Fantasy' AND price < 20.00;
```

This finds all fantasy books under $20. Here are the comparison tools in your detective kit:
- `=` (equals): "Show me customers from New York"
- `>` and `<` (greater/less than): "Show me orders over $50"
- `>=` and `<=` (greater/less than or equal to): "Show me products with 5 or more units in stock"
- `<>` or `!=` (not equal): "Show me everything except canceled orders"

You can combine clues with logical operators:
- `AND`: Both conditions must be true (like "mystery books AND hardcover")
- `OR`: Either condition can be true (like "fiction OR biography")
- `NOT`: The opposite of a condition (like "NOT out of stock")

Let's say you manage an online bookstore and need to find high-value customers who might warrant special attention:

```sql
SELECT customer_name, email FROM customers
WHERE (total_purchases > 1000 OR books_purchased > 20) 
AND last_purchase_date >= '2023-01-01';
```

This finds your VIP customers who either spent over $1,000 OR bought more than 20 books, AND have purchased something this year.

#### ORDER BY: Sorting Your Results Like a Pro

If WHERE is about filtering, ORDER BY is about organizing. It's like telling the library, "Show me these books, but arrange them by publication date from newest to oldest."

```sql
SELECT product_name, price, stock_quantity
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC, product_name ASC;
```

This sorts products by price (highest first), and when prices are equal, alphabetically by name. The `DESC` means descending (high to low, Z to A), while `ASC` (the default if you don't specify) means ascending (low to high, A to Z).

#### GROUP BY: Summarizing Data Like a Business Executive

The GROUP BY clause is how you create summaries and reports. Imagine being able to instantly answer questions like "How many books do we have in each genre?" or "What's our average sale price by month?"

```sql
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) as book_count, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM books
GROUP BY genre;
```

This gives you a neat summary showing how many books and the average price for EACH genre, instead of individual book listings.

Common aggregation functions that work with GROUP BY include:
- `COUNT()`: "How many products do we have in each category?"
- `SUM()`: "What's our total revenue by month?"
- `AVG()`: "What's the average rating for each product?"
- `MAX()` and `MIN()`: "What's our best and worst selling product?"

#### HAVING: The "WHERE" Clause for Groups

Think of HAVING as the WHERE clause's cousin that works with groups. WHERE filters individual rows BEFORE they're grouped, but HAVING filters the groups AFTER they're created.

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as product_count, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(price) < 50;
```

This shows only categories that have more than 5 products AND an average price under $50.

#### LIMIT: For When You Don't Need the Whole Library

The LIMIT clause is like saying, "Just show me the first few results, I don't need everything." It's perfect for showing top sellers, recent orders, or paginating through search results:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY sales_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This shows your top 10 best-selling products without having to wade through your entire catalog.

### Data Rules: Constraints That Keep Your Database Healthy

Think of constraints as the guardrails that keep your data clean and reliable. Without them, people might enter invalid emails, duplicate IDs, or leave critical fields empty.

1. **PRIMARY KEY: The Unique Identifier**
   
   Every book in a library has a unique catalog number. Similarly, in databases, we need a unique way to identify each row:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
     student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- No two students can have the same ID
     name VARCHAR(100)
   );
   ```
   
   The primary key is like a social security number for your data – absolutely unique and never empty.

2. **FOREIGN KEY: Creating Relationships**
   
   Foreign keys connect tables together, like how a library card connects a person to the books they've borrowed:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     customer_id INT,
     order_date DATE,
     FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
   );
   ```
   
   This ensures you can't create an order for a customer who doesn't exist!

3. **UNIQUE: One of a Kind**
   
   Some things should never be duplicated, like email addresses in a user database:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,  -- No two users can have the same email
     username VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

4. **NOT NULL: Must Be Present**
   
   Some fields should never be empty, like the name on a shipping label:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE customers (
     customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- Every customer must have a name
     phone VARCHAR(20)            -- Phone is optional
   );
   ```

5. **CHECK: Validating Data**
   
   CHECK constraints are like bouncers at a club – they only let in values that meet certain criteria:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
     product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price > 0),  -- No negative prices allowed!
     weight DECIMAL(8,2) CHECK (weight > 0)  -- Weight must be positive
   );
   ```

These constraints work together to keep your database sane and your applications reliable!

## Advanced Topics

### Bringing It All Together: Joins, the SQL Superpower

Remember our bookstore example? In real life, you wouldn't keep all your data in one massive table. You'd have separate tables for customers, orders, products, and more. But how do you connect them? That's where joins come in!

Think of joins like detective work connecting clues from different sources. "Show me all orders (from the orders table) WITH the customer info (from the customers table) AND the product details (from the products table)."

#### The JOIN Family: Different Ways to Connect Tables

Let me explain joins using two tables: `customers` (people who buy books) and `orders` (book purchases):

1. **INNER JOIN: "Show me only where there's a match"**
   
   This is like finding the overlap in a Venn diagram – only customers who have placed orders:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date, orders.amount
   FROM customers
   INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
   ```
   
   If a customer hasn't placed any orders, they won't appear in the results.

2. **LEFT JOIN: "Show me all from the left table, with matches from the right"**
   
   This shows ALL customers, even if they haven't placed orders:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT customers.name, 
          COALESCE(orders.order_date, 'No orders yet') as order_date
   FROM customers
   LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
   ```
   
   Customers with no orders will still appear, with NULL values for order details (which we handle with COALESCE).

3. **RIGHT JOIN: "Show me all from the right table, with matches from the left"**
   
   This shows ALL orders, even if we somehow lost customer info:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT COALESCE(customers.name, 'Unknown customer') as name, 
          orders.order_date, orders.amount
   FROM customers
   RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
   ```

4. **FULL JOIN: "Show me everything from both tables"**
   
   This shows ALL customers and ALL orders:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
   FROM customers
   FULL JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
   ```

[Image: A visual representation of different join types using Venn diagrams, showing how INNER JOIN returns the intersection while other joins include all records from one or both tables]

### SQL Inception: Queries Inside Queries with Subqueries

Subqueries are like inception for databases – queries nested inside other queries. They let you use the results of one query as input for another.

For example, "Show me all customers who purchased a specific book":

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE product_id = 123
);
```

This first finds all orders for product #123, then finds customers who placed those orders.

Here's another real-world example: "Find employees who make more than their department's average salary":

```sql
SELECT name, salary, department
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department = e2.department
);
```

This compares each employee's salary against their own department's average!

### Transaction Safety: All or Nothing Operations

Imagine you're transferring money between bank accounts. You need to:
1. Subtract money from one account
2. Add it to another account

If your system crashes after step 1 but before step 2, money would vanish! Transactions prevent this by ensuring either ALL operations complete successfully or NONE of them happen:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Withdraw $500 from checking account
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 
    WHERE account_id = 1 AND account_type = 'Checking';
    
    -- Deposit $500 to savings account
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 
    WHERE account_id = 1 AND account_type = 'Savings';
    
    -- Only if both operations succeed:
    COMMIT;
```

If anything goes wrong, you can roll back the transaction:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

This undoes all changes since the BEGIN TRANSACTION, keeping your data consistent!

### Dealing with the Unexpected: Error Handling

Even the best SQL queries can sometimes fail. Understanding error messages is crucial for troubleshooting:

1. **"Oops, typo!" - Syntax Errors**
   ```
   ERROR: syntax error at or near "SLECT"
   ```
   This happens when you make typing mistakes like "SLECT" instead of "SELECT". Double-check your spelling!

2. **"That's already taken!" - Constraint Violations**
   ```
   ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "users_email_key"
   ```
   This happens when you try to insert a duplicate value where uniqueness is required, like two users with the same email.

3. **"Apples and oranges" - Data Type Mismatches**
   ```
   ERROR: column "age" is of type integer but expression is of type character varying
   ```
   This happens when you try to store text in a number field, or vice versa.

4. **"Access denied" - Permission Errors**
   ```
   ERROR: permission denied for table employees
   ```
   This happens when your database user doesn't have the required permissions.

Different database systems handle errors differently. In SQL Server, you can use try/catch blocks:

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO customers (email) VALUES ('john@example.com');
    -- More SQL statements
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'Oops! Something went wrong: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE() AS ErrorMessage;
    -- Handle the error gracefully
END CATCH;
```

In PostgreSQL, you might use:

```sql
DO $
BEGIN
    -- Your SQL statements here
EXCEPTION WHEN others THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Error occurred: %', SQLERRM;
END $;
```

Remember: good error handling makes the difference between "the system crashed!" and "there was a small issue that's now resolved."

## Examples and Use Cases

Now let's see SQL in action with some real-world scenarios! These examples show how everything we've learned comes together to solve actual business problems.

### Example 1: Managing an Online Bookstore

Let's imagine you run "Page Turner," an online bookstore. Here's how SQL helps you run your business:

**Adding new books to your inventory:**
```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, genre, price, stock_quantity)
VALUES ('SQL For Book Lovers', 'Query Master', 'Technology', 34.99, 50);
```

**Finding your bestsellers for a marketing campaign:**
```sql
SELECT b.title, b.author, SUM(od.quantity) as copies_sold
FROM order_details od
JOIN books b ON od.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY b.title, b.author
ORDER BY copies_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
This shows your top 5 bestselling books this year!

**Updating prices during a seasonal sale:**
```sql
UPDATE books
SET price = price * 0.

## Exercises and Quizzes

### Exercise 1: Basic SQL Commands
Write SQL queries to:
1. Select all columns from a table named 'customers'
2. Insert a new record into a table named 'orders'
3. Update the phone number of a customer with ID 101

SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics
Introduction (68 words)
Hey there, future database wizard! Welcome to SQL, the language for talking to databases. Think of it as your librarian for billions of books, helping you find, remember, and update data. Whether you dream of uncovering patterns as a data analyst, building apps as a web developer, or just understanding the digital world, SQL is your golden ticket. In this journey, we'll learn to converse with databases, unlocking the magic behind every app and website!

Beginner's Guide (498 words)
Imagine you've landed a job at a coffee shop. You need to learn how to ask for specific beans, record sales, and update inventory. SQL is the database equivalent!

Born at IBM in the 1970s, SQL is a specialized language for having conversations with super-organized librarians who know where everything is:

"Show me all the fantasy books published after 2010?"
"Add this new book to the science fiction section?"
"Fix the author listed in this history book?"
"Remove these outdated travel guides."
Each request is achievable with SQL!

In SQL, statements end with semicolons (;), like periods in sentences. Here's a simple SQL statement:

SELECT first\_name FROM customers;

It almost reads like simplified English!

Let's dive into the four essential spells (CRUD Operations):

SELECT (Read): Retrieves data.

SELECT name, price FROM products; (Show me the name and price of all products.)

SELECT \* FROM customers; (Show me everything about all customers.)

INSERT (Create): Adds new rows to a table.

INSERT INTO books (title, author, price) VALUES ('The SQL Adventure', 'Data Wizard', 19.99); (Add a new book.)

UPDATE (Update): Modifies existing data.

UPDATE books SET price = 24.99, author = 'Jane Data Wizard' WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure'; (Fixes the typo.)

DELETE (Delete): Removes data.

DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure'; (Removes a book.)

Treat data types as containers. You wouldn't store soup in a shopping bag or groceries in a coffee mug, right?

Numbers: INTEGER, DECIMAL, FLOAT.
Text: VARCHAR, TEXT, CHAR.
Dates and Times: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP.
Yes/No Values: BOOLEAN.
Intermediate Concepts (681 words)
Now, let's level up with SQL clauses!

WHERE: Filters rows based on specified conditions.

SELECT title, author, price FROM books WHERE genre = 'Fantasy' AND price < 20.00; (Fantasy books under \$20.)

Comparison operators: =, >, <, >=, <=, <>, !=

Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT

SELECT customer\_name, email FROM customers WHERE (total\_purchases > 1000 OR books\_purchased > 20) AND last\_purchase\_date >= '2023-01-01'; (VIP customers.)

ORDER BY: Sorts results.

SELECT product\_name, price, stock\_quantity FROM products ORDER BY price DESC, product\_name ASC; (Sorts products by price and name.)

DESC (descending), ASC (ascending).

GROUP BY: Groups rows with the same values.

SELECT genre, COUNT(\*) as book\_count, AVG(price) as avg\_price FROM books GROUP BY genre; (Shows book count and average price for each genre.)

Common aggregation functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN().

HAVING: Filters groups based on aggregate results.

SELECT category, COUNT(*) as product\_count FROM products GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(*) > 5; (Shows categories with more than 5 products.)

LIMIT: Restricts the number of rows returned.

SELECT product\_name, price FROM products ORDER BY sales\_count DESC LIMIT 10; (Shows top 10 best-selling products.)

Constraints are like guardrails that keep your data clean and reliable:

PRIMARY KEY: The unique identifier (like a social security number).

CREATE TABLE students (
student\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- No two students can have the same ID
name VARCHAR(100)
);
FOREIGN KEY: Connects tables (like a library card).

CREATE TABLE orders (
order\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer\_id INT,
order\_date DATE,
FOREIGN KEY (customer\_id) REFERENCES customers(customer\_id) REFERENCES customers(customer\_id);
);
UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are different.

CREATE TABLE users (
user\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,  -- No two users can have the same email
username VARCHAR(50)
);
NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot contain NULL values.

CREATE TABLE customers (
customer\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- Every customer must have a name
phone VARCHAR(20)            -- Phone is optional
);
CHECK: Validates data.

CREATE TABLE products (
product\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price > 0),  -- No negative prices allowed!
weight DECIMAL(8,2) CHECK (weight > 0)  -- Weight must be positive
);

Advanced Topics (249 words)
Here, we would explore the concepts of SQL Joins to combine related tables. Also, we can use SQL Inception queries inside queries with Subqueries as well and prevent system errors. Furthermore, to make transaction safe, we can discuss transaction control and also discuss different data management and their effective resolutions.

These would be a huge add on to uplift knowledge and apply practically for further steps.

## OUTPUT : 

    [ SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics

    ## Introduction

    Structured Query Language (SQL) is the cornerstone of relational database interaction. Whether you're querying your favorite e-commerce app for recent purchases, building admin dashboards, or performing analytics, SQL is the language making it all happen. Developed at IBM in the 1970s, SQL has become the universal method for communicating with databases. In this journey, you will learn to write efficient SQL queries that retrieve, modify, and manage data with ease.

    ---

    ## Beginner's Guide

    ### What is SQL?

    SQL is a declarative language used to interact with relational databases. Think of it like giving commands to a highly efficient librarian who knows where every book is stored.

    SQL statements often mimic plain English and are terminated with semicolons:

    ```sql
    SELECT first_name FROM customers;
    ```

    This retrieves the `first_name` column from the `customers` table.

    ### CRUD Operations

    These are the four essential operations:

    * **Create (INSERT):**

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO books (title, author, price) VALUES ('The SQL Adventure', 'Data Wizard', 19.99);
    ```

    * **Read (SELECT):**

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM customers;
    ```

    * **Update (UPDATE):**

    ```sql
    UPDATE books SET price = 24.99 WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure';
    ```

    * **Delete (DELETE):**

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure';
    ```

    ### Data Types Overview

    * **Numbers:** `INTEGER`, `DECIMAL`, `FLOAT`
    * **Text:** `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `CHAR`
    * **Dates & Times:** `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`
    * **Boolean:** `BOOLEAN`

    These help structure and validate the data stored.

    ---

    ## Intermediate Concepts

    ### WHERE Clause

    Filters rows that meet specific criteria:

    ```sql
    SELECT title, author FROM books WHERE genre = 'Fantasy';
    ```

    ### ORDER BY

    Sorts results:

    ```sql
    SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
    ```

    ### GROUP BY with Aggregation

    Summarizes data:

    ```sql
    SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY genre;
    ```

    ### HAVING Clause

    Filters grouped data:

    ```sql
    SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY genre HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
    ```

    ### LIMIT Clause

    Restricts result size:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```

    ### SQL Constraints

    * **PRIMARY KEY:** Ensures uniqueness
    * **FOREIGN KEY:** Maintains relationships
    * **UNIQUE:** Prevents duplicate values
    * **NOT NULL:** Disallows null values
    * **CHECK:** Enforces custom rules

    Example:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age > 0)
    );
    ```

    ---

    ## Advanced Topics

    ### Joins

    Combine data from multiple tables:

    ```sql
    SELECT c.name, o.order_date FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
    ```

    Types:

    * INNER JOIN
    * LEFT JOIN
    * RIGHT JOIN
    * FULL OUTER JOIN

    ### Subqueries

    Query within a query:

    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM customers WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100
    );
    ```

    ### Transactions

    Ensures all-or-nothing execution:

    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
    COMMIT;
    ```

    Use `ROLLBACK;` to cancel.

    ---

    ## Examples and Use Cases

    **E-commerce Platform:**

    * **Add a new product:**

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO products (name, category, price) VALUES ('Wireless Mouse', 'Electronics', 19.99);
    ```

    * **Top 5 selling books:**

    ```sql
    SELECT b.title, SUM(oi.quantity) as sold
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN books b ON oi.book_id = b.book_id
    GROUP BY b.title
    ORDER BY sold DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

    * **Update prices for clearance:**

    ```sql
    UPDATE products SET price = price * 0.8 WHERE category = 'Clearance';
    ```

# Agent 5 : Distributor Agent

# Prompt : 
``` block 

You are an expert AI agent called the Distributor Agent. Your role is to take validated and refined content and distribute it to different downstream processes for an online learning platform. You will be provided with the topic name, its category, its priority, and the validated content. Your task is to format the data appropriately for three different channels: Database Inserts, Problem Setting, and Reinforcement Chain.

**Input:**

Topic Name: \[Topic Name from Agent 4/5] Category: \[Category from Agent 4/5] Priority: \[Priority from Agent 4/5] Validated Content: \[Validated and refined content from Agent 4/5, including Introduction, Beginner's Guide, Intermediate Concepts, Advanced Topics, Examples and Use Cases, Exercises and Quizzes, Further Reading, and Summary Note]

**Instructions:**

1. **Database Inserts (Agent 6.1.1 and 6.1.2):**

   * **Topic Inserter (Agent 6.1.1):** Create a JSON object containing the following information for insertion into the topic list:

     ```json
     {
       "topic_title": "[Topic Name]",
       "module_id": "[To be filled in by admin or system - example: 'ML001']",

SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics
Introduction
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the cornerstone of relational database interaction. Whether you're querying your favorite e-commerce app for recent purchases, building admin dashboards, or performing analytics, SQL is the language making it all happen. Developed at IBM in the 1970s, SQL has become the universal method for communicating with databases. In this journey, you will learn to write efficient SQL queries that retrieve, modify, and manage data with ease.

Beginner's Guide
What is SQL? SQL is a declarative language used to interact with relational databases. Think of it like giving commands to a highly efficient librarian who knows where every book is stored. SQL statements often mimic plain English and are terminated with semicolons: SELECT first\_name FROM customers; This retrieves the first\_name column from the customers table. CRUD Operations These are the four essential operations: Create (INSERT): INSERT INTO books (title, author, price) VALUES ('The SQL Adventure', 'Data Wizard', 19.99); Read (SELECT): SELECT \* FROM customers; Update (UPDATE): UPDATE books SET price = 24.99 WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure'; Delete (DELETE): DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure'; Data Types Overview Numbers: INTEGER, DECIMAL, FLOAT Text: VARCHAR, TEXT, CHAR Dates & Times: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP Boolean: BOOLEAN These help structure and validate the data stored.

Intermediate Concepts
WHERE Clause Filters rows that meet specific criteria: SELECT title, author FROM books WHERE genre = 'Fantasy'; ORDER BY Sorts results: SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC; GROUP BY with Aggregation Summarizes data: SELECT genre, COUNT() FROM books GROUP BY genre; HAVING Clause Filters grouped data: SELECT genre, COUNT() FROM books GROUP BY genre HAVING COUNT(\*) > 5; LIMIT Clause Restricts result size: SELECT \* FROM books ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10; SQL Constraints PRIMARY KEY: Ensures uniqueness FOREIGN KEY: Maintains relationships UNIQUE: Prevents duplicate values NOT NULL: Disallows null values CHECK: Enforces custom rules Example: CREATE TABLE users ( user\_id INT PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE, is\_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL, age INT CHECK (age > 0) );

Advanced Topics
Joins Combine data from multiple tables: SELECT c.name, o.order\_date FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer\_id = o.customer\_id; Types: INNER JOIN LEFT JOIN RIGHT JOIN FULL OUTER JOIN Subqueries Query within a query: SELECT name FROM customers WHERE customer\_id IN ( SELECT customer\_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100 ); Transactions Ensures all-or-nothing execution: BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account\_id = 1; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account\_id = 2; COMMIT; Use ROLLBACK; to cancel.

Exercises and Quizzes
Practice: Select all customers from New York. Insert a new order for customer\_id 42. Find products with price > \$100, sorted descending. Group orders by customer and show total amount spent. Delete all orders before 2020. Quiz: Which command is used to retrieve data? ✅ c) SELECT What clause filters groups? ✅ b) HAVING Which is NOT a valid SQL type? ✅ c) ARRAY What does SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM orders GROUP BY customer\_id; return? ✅ b) Number of orders per customer Which constraint disallows NULL values? ✅ c) NOT NULL

**📌 Problem Setter Head Agent — Workforce Instructions**
**Topic:** SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics
**Category:** Fundamental
**Priority:** High

This instructional briefing is for my 5 Problem Reviewer Agents (Agent 6.2.2) to create diverse, challenging, and well-aligned problem statements for the SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics module.

---

### ✅ Agent 1

**Assigned Content Section:** *Introduction + Beginner’s Guide (What is SQL? CRUD, Data Types)*
**Summary:** Introduces SQL as a declarative language for relational databases and covers the foundational CRUD operations (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) and common data types (INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN, etc.).

**Instructions:**
Create a problem statement that requires learners to use **all four CRUD operations** and apply **appropriate SQL data types** in a simple, real-world scenario. The problem should guide them to construct a basic schema and perform operations on it using correct syntax.

**Example:**

> “You are managing a music streaming app database.
> a) Create a `songs` table with columns: song\_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY), title (VARCHAR), artist (VARCHAR), duration (FLOAT), release\_date (DATE), is\_explicit (BOOLEAN).
> b) Insert two new songs.
> c) Update one song’s title.
> d) Delete songs released before 2020.
> Write all four SQL statements.”

**Do's:**

* Include all CRUD operations.
* Use appropriate data types for each column.
* Include a mini-schema if helpful.
* Write clear multi-part instructions.

**Dont's:**

* Don’t include JOINs, subqueries, or advanced clauses.
* Avoid vague use cases (e.g., generic tables without meaning).
* Don’t use non-standard SQL syntax.

---

### ✅ Agent 2

**Assigned Content Section:** *Intermediate Concepts (WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, LIMIT)*
**Summary:** Teaches filtering, sorting, grouping, and summarizing data, with examples using books, genres, and prices. Focuses on precision and aggregation.

**Instructions:**
Design a scenario that requires learners to **filter**, **group**, **sort**, and **limit** data using real-world tables. Ensure learners understand the difference between `WHERE` vs `HAVING`, and guide them to combine **at least 3** intermediate clauses in a single query.

**Example:**

> “In a university’s course registration system, the `registrations` table has columns: course\_id, student\_id, semester, grade.
> a) Write a query to count how many students registered per course in semester ‘Fall 2023’.
> b) Only include courses with more than 50 students.
> c) Sort by number of students in descending order.
> d) Show only the top 3 results.”

**Do's:**

* Focus on combining multiple intermediate SQL clauses.
* Use realistic datasets (e.g., university, store, ticket booking).
* Highlight differences between WHERE and HAVING.

**Dont's:**

* Don’t repeat simple SELECT \* FROM WHERE queries.
* Avoid using joins or nested subqueries.

---

### ✅ Agent 3

**Assigned Content Section:** *SQL Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)*
**Summary:** Describes how constraints maintain data integrity in relational databases, using a `users` table as an example. Explains how constraints prevent invalid or duplicate data.

**Instructions:**
Write a problem that requires defining a table with **at least 4 constraints** and explaining their use. The scenario should be relatable (e.g., user sign-up, booking systems) and must demonstrate how constraints affect data validity.

**Example:**

> “You’re designing a `hotel_guests` table for a booking system.
> Requirements:
>
> * Each guest must have a unique guest\_id.
> * The email must be unique.
> * Age must be above 18.
> * The phone number must not be NULL.
>   a) Write a CREATE TABLE statement with all constraints.
>   b) Briefly explain why each constraint is necessary.”

**Do's:**

* Use realistic and meaningful constraint use cases.
* Include a CREATE TABLE statement.
* Highlight the importance of each constraint.

**Dont's:**

* Avoid abstract or over-complicated schemas.
* Don’t use advanced SQL features like triggers or stored procedures.

### ✅ Agent 4

**Assigned Content Section:** *Advanced Topics (JOINs, Subqueries, Transactions)*
**Summary:** Explains combining tables with different JOIN types, using subqueries, and executing atomic operations with transactions. Includes realistic banking and customer/order examples.

**Instructions:**
Design a multi-step problem that requires **at least one JOIN** and **either a subquery or transaction block**. The scenario should reflect a real-world need for multi-table operations—e.g., banking, e-commerce, or logistics.

**Example:**

> “A logistics firm has:
>
> * `drivers(driver_id, name)`
> * `deliveries(delivery_id, driver_id, delivery_date, status)`
>   a) Write a query to list drivers who completed more than 5 deliveries in March 2023.
>   b) Use JOIN and GROUP BY.
>   c) Rewrite (a) using a subquery.
>   d) Now assume two delivery records were mistakenly marked as ‘cancelled’. Write a transaction block to revert their status.”

**Do's:**

* Include at least one JOIN and optionally subquery or transaction.
* Use real-world, cross-table scenarios.
* Encourage comparison of approaches (e.g., join vs subquery).

**Dont's:**

* Don’t test only SELECT \* JOIN …
* Avoid abstract or theoretical database structures.

### ✅ Agent 5

**Assigned Content Section:** *Real-World Use Cases + Exercises and Quizzes*
**Summary:** Presents end-to-end examples like updating clearance product prices, top selling books, inserting new orders, and multiple-choice SQL questions.

**Instructions:**
Create an open-ended problem that simulates a **real-world application** (e.g., e-commerce, school, banking) and requires a learner to perform **data analysis or reporting** using multiple SQL features. Encourage realistic, critical thinking.

**Example:**

> “An online learning platform tracks course enrollments in a table `enrollments(student_id, course_id, enrollment_date, price_paid)`.
> a) Find the top 3 most-enrolled courses after Jan 2022.
> b) What is the average revenue per course?
> c) Write a query to show total revenue by month.
> d) Identify which course had no enrollments in the last 6 months.”

**Do's:**

* Simulate real-world analysis or reports.
* Require combining multiple SQL techniques.
* Encourage learner interpretation and insight.

**Dont's:**

* Don’t focus only on syntax recall (like SELECT \* FROM …).
* Avoid purely factual or binary problems (e.g., multiple choice only).

``` block

**✅ Problem Statement (Intermediate SQL – Filtering, Grouping, Sorting, and Limiting):**

---

**Scenario:**
A public library system wants to evaluate which book genres are the most borrowed by users recently, so it can adjust its acquisition budget. You have access to the following table:

```
    borrow_records (record_id, user_id, genre, borrow_date, return_date, book_price)
```

The library wants a report that highlights the most borrowed genres based on total monetary value (approximated by `book_price`) in the current year.

---

**Your task:**
Write a SQL query that:

1. Calculates the **total book\_price** borrowed for each **genre**.
2. Includes only records where the `borrow_date` is **after '2024-01-01'**.
3. Only includes **genres** where the total value of borrowed books is **greater than \$2000**.
4. Sorts the results by **total borrowed value** in **descending order**.
5. Limits the results to the **top 5 genres**.

---

**Educational Focus:**

* **WHERE** filters rows *before* grouping (e.g., by `borrow_date`).
* **GROUP BY** groups rows by `genre`.
* **HAVING** filters on *aggregated* results (e.g., total `book_price`).
* **ORDER BY** sorts the aggregated data.
* **LIMIT** restricts the final result set.

---

**Example Learning Discussion:**

> “The `WHERE` clause filters out borrow records that occurred before 2024, so we only analyze recent data. `GROUP BY` organizes borrow records by genre. Then, `HAVING` filters out genres that didn’t cross the \$2000 threshold in value. Finally, `ORDER BY` ranks them, and `LIMIT` gives the top 5 results.”

3. 

``` 
    Here is a **Beginner-Level SQL Problem** for the **SQL Constraints** section, incorporating at least four constraints and emphasizing data integrity in a realistic context.

    ---

    ### 🧩 Problem Title: **Creating a Secure Users Table for a Web Application**

    ### 📝 Problem Statement:

    You're tasked with designing a table named `users` for a modern web application. This table will store essential user account details required during the sign-up process. The client has outlined the following validation rules to ensure **data consistency** and **security**:

    #### Requirements:

    * Every user must have a unique `user_id`.
    * Email addresses must be **unique** to prevent duplicate accounts.
    * Passwords must not be `NULL`.
    * Usernames must be provided and cannot be blank.
    * Age must be **at least 13** years (as per app policy for minors).

    ---

    ### 🔧 Tasks:

    **a)** Write a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement to define the `users` table using the appropriate constraints.

    **b)** Explain the purpose of **each constraint** you used and how it ensures valid data entry.

    ---

    ### 💡 Example Structure to Implement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
        age INT CHECK (age >= 13)
    );
    ```

    ---

    ### ✅ Constraint Explanations:

    * **PRIMARY KEY (user\_id):** Ensures that each user has a unique identifier and no duplicate rows are allowed based on the primary key.
    * **NOT NULL (username, email, password):** Prevents users from leaving critical fields empty during registration.
    * **UNIQUE (email):** Guarantees that no two users can register with the same email address, avoiding account collisions.
    * **CHECK (age >= 13):** Enforces the application’s age restriction policy to block underage users.

    ---

    ### ❌ What *Not* to Do:

    * Do not include foreign keys or references to other tables.
    * Do not include advanced database logic (e.g., triggers, views).
    * Focus purely on **basic constraints and table definition** for clarity.

    ### 💼 **Scenario: Banking Fraud Monitoring and Correction**

    You are working as a **Lead Data Engineer** at *TrustBank*, a modern digital banking platform. The compliance team suspects anomalies in fund transfers and requests a data report and corrective transaction logic.

    ---

    ### 🧩 **Database Schema**

    ```sql
    CUSTOMERS (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR,
    email VARCHAR,
    registered_on DATE
    )

    ACCOUNTS (
    account_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(customer_id),
    account_type VARCHAR CHECK (account_type IN ('savings', 'checking')),
    balance DECIMAL(12,2)
    )

    TRANSFERS (
    transfer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_account_id INT REFERENCES ACCOUNTS(account_id),
    receiver_account_id INT REFERENCES ACCOUNTS(account_id),
    transfer_date TIMESTAMP,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR CHECK (status IN ('completed', 'failed', 'reversed'))
    )

    REVERSALS (
    reversal_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    original_transfer_id INT REFERENCES TRANSFERS(transfer_id),
    reversed_on TIMESTAMP,
    reason TEXT
    )
    ```

    ---

    ### 🎯 **Your Tasks**

    #### **Part A: Identify suspicious fund transfers**

    Write a SQL query to list all customers who:

    * **Sent money to the same receiver more than 3 times in a single day**, where each transfer was above ₹10,000.
    * For each such sender-receiver pair, return:

    * `sender_name`, `receiver_name`, `transfer_date (date only)`, `number_of_transfers`, `total_amount_transferred`

    Use at least one **JOIN** and **GROUP BY**, and avoid `SELECT *`.

    ---

    #### **Part B: Write the same logic using a correlated subquery**

    Return the same output using a subquery instead of a GROUP BY JOIN.

    ---

    #### **Part C: Correction via Transaction Block**

    Assume compliance found that two specific `transfer_id`s (say `1012` and `1017`) were mistakenly marked as `"completed"` instead of `"reversed"`. You need to:

    * Write a **transaction block** that:

    * Updates their status to `'reversed'`.
    * Inserts a new record into `REVERSALS` for each.
    * Rolls back if either insertion fails.

    Use standard **PostgreSQL transaction syntax**.

    ---

    ### 🧷 **Constraints & Instructions**

    * Use **INNER JOINs** for sender/receiver linking via `ACCOUNTS → CUSTOMERS`.
    * You **must not** assume sender and receiver belong to different customers.
    * Avoid cartesian joins or unnecessary nested loops.
    * Optimize readability and maintainability.
    * No use of `SELECT *`.

    ---

    ### ✅ **Optional Bonus**

    Write a query to find **customers who both sent and received money to/from the same person on the same day**, involving at least ₹25,000 cumulatively.

SQL Fundamentals and Syntax Basics
Introduction
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the cornerstone of relational database interaction. Whether you're querying your favorite e-commerce app for recent purchases, building admin dashboards, or performing analytics, SQL is the language making it all happen. Developed at IBM in the 1970s, SQL has become the universal method for communicating with databases. In this journey, you will learn to write efficient SQL queries that retrieve, modify, and manage data with ease.

Beginner's Guide
What is SQL? SQL is a declarative language used to interact with relational databases. Think of it like giving commands to a highly efficient librarian who knows where every book is stored. SQL statements often mimic plain English and are terminated with semicolons: SELECT first\_name FROM customers; This retrieves the first\_name column from the customers table. CRUD Operations These are the four essential operations: Create (INSERT): INSERT INTO books (title, author, price) VALUES ('The SQL Adventure', 'Data Wizard', 19.99); Read (SELECT): SELECT \* FROM customers; Update (UPDATE): UPDATE books SET price = 24.99 WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure'; Delete (DELETE): DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'The SQL Adventure'; Data Types Overview Numbers: INTEGER, DECIMAL, FLOAT Text: VARCHAR, TEXT, CHAR Dates & Times: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP Boolean: BOOLEAN These help structure and validate the data stored.

Intermediate Concepts
WHERE Clause Filters rows that meet specific criteria: SELECT title, author FROM books WHERE genre = 'Fantasy'; ORDER BY Sorts results: SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC; GROUP BY with Aggregation Summarizes data: SELECT genre, COUNT() FROM books GROUP BY genre; HAVING Clause Filters grouped data: SELECT genre, COUNT() FROM books GROUP BY genre HAVING COUNT(\*) > 5; LIMIT Clause Restricts result size: SELECT \* FROM books ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10; SQL Constraints PRIMARY KEY: Ensures uniqueness FOREIGN KEY: Maintains relationships UNIQUE: Prevents duplicate values NOT NULL: Disallows null values CHECK: Enforces custom rules Example: CREATE TABLE users ( user\_id INT PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE, is\_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL, age INT CHECK (age > 0) );

Advanced Topics
Joins Combine data from multiple tables: SELECT c.name, o.order\_date FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer\_id = o.customer\_id; Types: INNER JOIN LEFT JOIN RIGHT JOIN FULL OUTER JOIN Subqueries Query within a query: SELECT name FROM customers WHERE customer\_id IN ( SELECT customer\_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100 ); Transactions Ensures all-or-nothing execution: BEGIN; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account\_id = 1; UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account\_id = 2; COMMIT; Use ROLLBACK; to cancel.

Examples and Use Cases
E-commerce Platform: Add a new product: INSERT INTO products (name, category, price) VALUES ('Wireless Mouse', 'Electronics', 19.99); Top 5 selling books: SELECT b.title, SUM(oi.quantity) as sold FROM order\_items oi JOIN books b ON oi.book\_id = b.book\_id GROUP BY b.title ORDER BY sold DESC LIMIT 5; Update prices for clearance: UPDATE products SET price = price \* 0.8 WHERE category = 'Clearance';

Exercises and Quizzes
Practice: Select all customers from New York. Insert a new order for customer\_id 42. Find products with price > \$100, sorted descending. Group orders by customer and show total amount spent. Delete all orders before 2020. Quiz: Which command is used to retrieve data? ✅ c) SELECT What clause filters groups? ✅ b) HAVING Which is NOT a valid SQL type? ✅ c) ARRAY What does SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM orders GROUP BY customer\_id; return? ✅ b) Number of orders per customer Which constraint disallows NULL values? ✅ c) NOT NULL

### **Your Task: Generate a Sales and Operations Report**

Use SQL to answer the following:

---

**1. Book Performance**

a) Identify the **top 5 best-selling books** in the last 90 days by total quantity sold. Include title, author, total units sold, and revenue.

b) List all books that have **not been sold** at all in the last 6 months. These may be candidates for clearance or removal.

---

**2. Inventory & Pricing Strategy**

a) List all books where the **stock is below 15 units**, but they’ve sold more than **100 copies** in total since Jan 2023.

b) Suppose management wants to **mark down** books in the *Self Help* category that haven't sold in the last 4 months. Find these books and calculate a proposed clearance price at **20% discount**.

---

**3. Customer Behavior**

a) Find the **top 10 customers by total spending** in 2024 so far. Include their name, email, number of orders, and total spent.

b) Identify customers who **only ordered online** and never visited a physical store. How many such customers are there?

---

**4. Store Insights**

a) Compare revenue generated by **online vs. physical stores** in the last quarter.

b) For each physical city store, calculate:

* Total number of unique customers
* Average order value
* Most popular book category

---

### **Constraints & Expectations:**

* Use `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, `DATE` functions, and subqueries where appropriate.
* Do **not** modify the schema or hardcode IDs.
* Write clean, readable SQL.
* Assume today’s date is `'2025-05-01'`.

### ✅ **Your Task: Create an Operational Report using SQL**

Use **SQL queries** to answer the following questions. Ensure correct usage of joins, filtering, grouping, and aggregation. Base your calculations on the current date: `'2025-05-01'`.

---

#### 📈 **1. Book Performance**

**a.** List the **top 5 best-selling books** from the last **90 days**. Include:

* `title`, `author`, total units sold, total revenue (quantity × unit\_price)

**b.** Identify books that have **not been sold** in the past **6 months**. Useful for clearance decisions.

---

#### 🧮 **2. Inventory & Pricing Strategy**

**a.** Find books that:

* Have **stock < 15**
* And have sold **over 100 units** since **Jan 1, 2023**

**b.** For books in the *Self Help* category:

* Find those with **zero sales in the last 4 months**
* Propose a **clearance price** with a **20% discount** on the current price

---

#### 👤 **3. Customer Behavior**

**a.** Identify the **top 10 customers** by total spending in **2024**. Include:

* Name, email, number of orders, and total spent

**b.** Count how many customers have **only placed online orders**, never using physical stores

---

#### 🏬 **4. Store Insights**

**a.** Compare **total revenue** for:

* **Online store** vs **all physical stores** in the **last quarter**

**b.** For each **physical city store** (exclude 'Online'):

* Total number of **unique customers**
* **Average order value**
* **Most popular book category**

---

### 🔧 Constraints

* Use only the schema provided.
* Avoid hardcoded IDs or assumptions about values.
* Use `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, date functions (`DATE_SUB`, `CURRENT_DATE`, etc.), and subqueries as needed.
* Maintain clean and readable SQL syntax.
* Use `'2025-05-01'` as today’s date for calculations.

---

**Bonus Reflection:**
Which performance metric (units sold, revenue, or customer engagement) do you believe should influence inventory restocking the most—and why?

---

### QA Notes:

* **Clarity Improved:** Clearer structuring of each section and added explicit expectations for each sub-question (e.g., include fields, avoid assumptions).
* **Completeness Ensured:** Dates, time frames, and constraints were made explicit to avoid ambiguity.
* **Relevance & Realism:** Scenario is grounded in real-world data analytics use cases for retail businesses.
* **Difficulty Balanced:** Moderate to challenging, covering SQL joins, aggregations, subqueries, and conditional logic, suitable for intermediate learners.
* **Testability Confirmed:** Every question aligns directly with validated schema and content from earlier SQL modules.
