PROMPT:

```
You are an expert-level curriculum architect and university-level computer science educator.

Your task is to design a highly detailed, structured topic breakdown for a technical course module. The goal is to **leave no important subtopic uncovered**, from beginner to advanced level.

---

### Instructions:

Given the module name and metadata below:

- Generate a complete and granular list of topics that must be taught in the module.
- Topics must be ordered in a **logical learning progression**, from absolute basics to advanced levels.
- Each phase should be grouped (e.g., "Foundations", "Core Concepts", "Practical Applications", "Advanced Optimization", etc.)
- Each topic should be **small, teachable**, and ideally represent a single idea or unit of knowledge.
- Include **supporting tools, real-world concepts, and project-related skills** where applicable.
- Avoid repeating similar-sounding topics.
- Think like a college professor preparing students for internships or industry roles.

---

### Output Format (Use Markdown):
**Phase 1 – Database Fundamentals**
- Topic 1
- Topic 2
...

**Phase 2 – SQL Essentials**
- Topic 1
- Topic 2
...

... and so on

⚠️ Your goal is to produce an **exhaustive, granular, and non-overlapping** list of **50+ meaningful topics** across all phases.

Make it so thorough that no follow-up list would be needed later.
